# Task_Master_API

This project involves developing a java backend API that allows users to perform CRUD operations on a Todo model class using a lightweight database like SQLite and JDBC driver. The Todo model class represents the data structure of a single todo object that can be stored in the database. A Data Access Object (DAO) class is created to handle the CRUD operations using JDBC to communicate with the database. A RESTful API is then created using a lightweight framework like Spark with endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting todos. Finally, the API is tested using a tool like Postman to ensure it's working correctly, covering all endpoints and operations provided by the API.

#Tools

1. JDBC driver to set up a database connection for the project.
2. Lightweight database like SQLite for simplicity.
3. Framework like Spark for creating a RESTful API.
4. Tool Postman for testing the API.
5. JSON for representing the data sent between client and server.
